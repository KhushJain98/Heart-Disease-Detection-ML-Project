# Heart-Disease-Detection-ML-Project
Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Heart Disease Detection 
• Conducted a comparative study of various machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease, 
aiming to identify the most effective model for early detection. 
• Utilized Python libraries to build, train, and evaluate models on medical datasets. 
• Evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, achieving an 
accuracy of over 85% with Random Forest. 
• Implemented feature selection techniques to improve model performance and reduce complexity.
